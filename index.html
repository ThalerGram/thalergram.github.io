  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>
    We are building our own network and a private, end-to-end encrypted messaging application.
    The goal is to design a communication platform that does **not** require phone numbers, email addresses, or personal data for registration.
    We aim to remove metadata exposure (such as sender/receiver identities, IP addresses, and transaction details) from the network wherever possible,
    so users can communicate freely and securely while retaining full control over their data and coins.
