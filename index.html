  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>
    We are working to build our own network and a private, end-to-end encrypted messaging application.
    The goal is to design a communication platform that does **not** require phone numbers, email addresses, or personal data for registration.
    We aim to remove metadata exposure (such as sender/receiver identities, IP addresses, and transaction details) from the network wherever possible,
    so users can communicate freely and securely while retaining full control over their data and coins.

  <h3>Burn & Scarcity</h3>

  <p>
    TalerGram follows a long-term plan to increase scarcity and strengthen value 
    by implementing a controlled burn mechanism. Each month a portion of the tokens 
    allocated for market distribution will be permanently removed from circulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    All burn transactions will be published on the Polygon blockchain so the community 
    can independently verify them. We are committed to transparency â€” burn addresses 
    and transaction hashes will be shared in our official channels after each burn event.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to align TalerGramâ€™s monetary policy with the core principles of Bitcoin: 
    predictable issuance, deliberate scarcity, and resistance to arbitrary inflation. 
    Over time, these measures will help shape a more robust and scarce token economy.
  </p>

  <p>
    For details about upcoming burns and verification links, follow our official 
    <a href="https://x.com/ThalerGram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ThalerGram</a> 
    channel and the Session group.

  <h3>Future Blockchain & Token Migration</h3>

  <p>
    TØ§alerGram is currently issued as a token on the Polygon network. 
    Our long-term vision is to launch a dedicated blockchain designed 
    for secure, anonymous, and censorship-resistant communication and transactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the new TalerGram blockchain goes live, every holder of the current 
    Polygon-based token will receive <strong>1 native coin for each token</strong> they hold. 
    This guarantees a smooth migration and rewards early supporters of the project.
  </p>

  <p>
    The migration will be transparent, verifiable, and announced through our 
    official channels including 
    <a href="https://x.com/ThalerGram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ThalerGram</a> 
    and the Session community.
  </p>

<p>
  Detailed instructions for the claim and purchase process will be provided in our official 
  <a href="https://x.com/ThalerGram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X channel</a> 
  and in the private Session group.
